				<p>International Homeware is your one-stop destination when you think of crockeries, household electrical appliances, and glassware and kitchen utensils. With eleven showrooms all around the city, International Homeware has been serving all homemakers in the country with wide range of household items without compromising with quality and style since 1957. </p>

Changes are made in the business world drastically with newer and modern communication technologies. While responding to these changes, IHW has had a rapid progress in the development of a trading company with better solutions to import. Its suppliers include leading nations such as England, Italy, Brazil, Japan, Thailand and China. </p>
<p>

IHW is an ancestral business, blooming and expanding in the hands of Mr.Mizanur Rahman, who stepped into his father's shoes since 1977. Late Mr. Alhaj Abdul Wazed sowed the seeds of success of IHW, formerly under the name of "Crockeries View" in 1957 at old Dhaka. This expanded into three more showrooms under the names, "Unique Traders" (since 1964), "General Gift House" (since 1967) and "Unique Promotion" (since 1992). </p>
<p>

As of current records our company has about 160 employees in Dhaka City and everyone is committed to serve you better in the coming days with our new, modern, trendy and stylish products. </p>
<p>

IHW has recently opened another branch at Banani, Dhaka. We want to show our highest appreciation to all our patrons, partners and most importantly our customers for supporting us all the way.
